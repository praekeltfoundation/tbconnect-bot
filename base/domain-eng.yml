        We will ask you about your choices in relation to the tool.
        
        üí≠ *What information will you ask me for?*

        We'll never ask your name, but may ask your ID number so that we can help 
        to link you to a facility to get tested. Providing your ID is completely up to you.
        We would only use it for your benefit.
        
        üí≠ *Why did I get this SMS?*

        We have chosen you at random from a database hosted by the Western Cape Department of Health.

        üí≠ *What will happen to the information?*

        We will store it safely as required by law and it will only be used by the Stellenbosch University
        and Erasmus University researchers.
        
        The information is stored without your name and ID. We will share what we find other researchers 
        and journals what we find, but what we share will be based on averages and totals from the full 
        group of survey participants.

        There are no costs and no risks. Your information will be kept private and safe. 
        The researchers will receive the answers without names or ID numbers.
